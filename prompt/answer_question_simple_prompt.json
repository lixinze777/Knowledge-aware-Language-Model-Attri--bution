["Who was Artemisia Gentileschi, when was she born, and what influences shaped her artistic style?","Artemisia Gentileschi [Q212657, name: Artemisia Gentileschi] was born Artemisia Gentileschi Lomi in Rome [Q212657, place of birth: Rome] on July 8 1593 [Q212657, date_of_birth: 1596-07-08] although her birth certificate from the Archivio di Stato indicated she was born in 1590 the eldest child of the Tuscan painter Orazio Gentileschi [Q212657, father: Orazio Gentileschi] [Q367360, name: Orazio Gentileschi, occupation: painter] and Prudenzia di Ottaviano Montoni. Her life and work were later depicted in the film \"Artemisia\" [Q212657, Artemisia Gentileschi, depicted by: Artemisia], which brought her story to a wider audience. Her father, Orazio, was a prominent figure in the Mannerism art movement [Q367360, Orazio Gentileschi, movement: mannerism], which likely influenced Artemisia's own artistic style. However, Artemisia herself was a part of the Caravaggisti movement [Q212657, Artemisia Gentileschi, movement: Caravaggisti], a group of artists who followed the style of Caravaggio. She was also a student of her father, Orazio Gentileschi [Q212657, Artemisia Gentileschi, student of: Orazio Gentileschi], which further shaped her artistic development. Orazio’s influence on Artemisia’s development as a prominent Baroque [NA] painter can be seen in her highly naturalistic portrayal of figures, dramatic scenes and the use of chiaroscuro technique [NA].",[{"name": "Orazio Gentileschi", "place of death": "London", "child": "Artemisia Gentileschi", "notable works": "Diana the Huntress", "given name": "Orazio", "surname": "Gentileschi", "languages spoken": "Italian", "movement": "mannerism", "work location": "Rome", "ethnic group": "Italians", "date_of_birth": "1563-07-19", "date_of_death": "1639-02-07", "qid": "Q367360"}, {"name": "Artemisia Gentileschi", "place of birth": "Rome", "place of death": "Naples", "occupation": "painter", "member of": "Accademia delle Arti del Disegno", "father": "Orazio Gentileschi", "notable works": "Judith Slaying Holofernes", "movement": "Caravaggisti", "ethnic group": "Italians", "work location": "Florence", "depicted by": "Artemisia", "surname": "Gentileschi", "languages spoken": "Italian", "student of": "Orazio Gentileschi", "given name": "Artemisia", "mother": "Prudenzia di Ottaviano Montoni", "date_of_death": "1654-01-01", "qid": "Q212657"}]]
